# Virtualization

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - free desktop virtualization software, only really for x86 / x86_64 based
  systems, current beta doesn't work on Mac Arm Silicon processors
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) - easy frontend to use qemu virtualization on Mac Apple Silicon Processors
- [Vagrant](vagrant.md) - automates VirtualBox VMs for easy reproduction of local labs with scripted provisioners or calling Puppet or similar (I used this a lot at [Cloudera](https://cloudera.com))
