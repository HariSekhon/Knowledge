# Packer

<https://www.packer.io/>

Packer is a tool for automating building virtual machines templates such as importable `.ova` files.

This usually involves running automated installers that are native to each Linux distribution such as:

- Debian [Preseed](debian.md#debian-preseeding---automated-installations)
- Redhat [Kickstart](redhat.md#kickstart---automated-installations)
- Ubuntu [Autoinstall](ubuntu.md#autoinstall---automated-installations)

See [HariSekhon/Packer](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Packer) repo.

Packer can be used to create AMI + Vagrant box at same time.
