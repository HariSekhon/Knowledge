# Packer

https://www.packer.io/

Packer is a tool for automating building virtual machines templates such as importable `.ova` files.

This usually involves running automated installers that are native to each Linux distribution such as
Redhat [Kickstart](redhat.md#kickstart---automated-installations),
Debian [Preseed](debian.md#debian-preseeding---automated-installations) and
Ubuntu [Autoinstall](ubuntu.md#autoinstall---automated-installations)
