# GitLab

https://gitlab.com

GitLab is the number 2 hosting provider for Git repos after [GitHub](github.md)

It has good feature parity with GitHub.com, although less 3rd party CI/CD integrations as everybody integrates to GitHub first .

## GitLab CI/CD

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` into the root directory of your git repo, then `git push` to GitLab.

Template to get you started:
