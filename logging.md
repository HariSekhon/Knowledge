## Syslog

The classic unix text based logging system which typically logs to the `/var/log/` directory.

Syslog can traditionally log to a remote syslog server on UDP port 514.

[Syslog-ng](syslog-ng.md) can log remotely over TCP 514 for reliability.

Common syslog logging daemons:

### Syslogd

The classic syslog daemon for unix system logging is simple to configure, but was outdated by the 2000s.

Consider using [Syslog-ng](syslog-ng.md) or RSyslog below instead.

### Syslog-ng

Excellent well-established next generation syslog daemon.

See [Syslog-ng](syslog-ng.md) doc.

### RSyslog

- Efficient for both small and large-scale environments
- Extremely customizable and supports multiple formats
- Good for distributed logging
  - supports [RELP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Event_Logging_Protocol) to prevent remote logging message
    loss

## Logging Systems

### ELK - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

- **Components**:
  - **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes logs
  - **Logstash**: Collects, parses, and enriches logs
  - **Kibana**: Visualizes logs in dashboards
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent for real-time log analysis
  - Highly scalable and flexible
  - Strong visualization with Kibana
- **Use Cases**: Centralized logging for distributed systems, troubleshooting, and metrics

### Graylog

- **Description**: Centralized log management system with enhanced search capabilities
- **Strengths**:
  - Built-in alerting and notifications
  - Supports structured and unstructured data
  - Scalable and easy-to-use UI
- **Use Cases**: Log aggregation and analysis, security auditing

### Prometheus

See [Prometheus](prometheus.md) doc.

- **Description**: Primarily used for monitoring and metrics, but it can also be used for logging
- **Strengths**:
  - Focus on metric collection with time-series databases
  - Integrates well with [Grafana](grafana.md) for visualization
  - Lightweight and efficient for real-time monitoring
- **Use Cases**: Infrastructure monitoring, microservices logging, and alerting

### Loki

by Grafana Labs.

- **Description**: Log aggregation system designed to work with [Grafana](grafana.md)
- **Strengths**:
  - Optimized for low cost and efficiency
  - Indexes metadata, not full logs, making it more lightweight
  - Ideal for environments where you already use [Prometheus](prometheus.md) and [Grafana](grafana.md)
- **Use Cases**: Lightweight logging in Kubernetes, cloud-native environments, and cost-effective log aggregation

### Papertrail

- **Description**: A log aggregation and management system with a focus on simplicity
- **Strengths**:
  - Simple, fast, and reliable
  - Provides real-time log searching and alerts
- **Use Cases**: Log aggregation for small to medium-sized systems

### Vector

- **Description**: A high-performance observability data pipeline
- **Strengths**:
  - Focused on performance and efficiency
  - Can handle logs, metrics, and traces in one unified platform
  - Lightweight and flexible, with support for multiple sources and destinations
- **Use Cases**: Handling both logs and metrics, observability pipelines for distributed systems

### Loggly

- **Description**: Cloud-based log management platform that offers a free version
- **Strengths**:
  - Provides real-time log analysis with powerful search capabilities
  - Cloud-native with fast setup
  - Offers integrations with DevOps tools
- **Use Cases**: Centralized logging for DevOps, debugging, and troubleshooting

### Summary

- **ELK Stack** and **Graylog** are great for full-scale log aggregation and search
- **Fluentd** and **Loki** are lightweight options ideal for cloud-native and Kubernetes environments
- **Prometheus** and **Vector** work well if youâ€™re handling both logs and metrics together
- **Syslog-ng** and **Rsyslog** are solid, mature solutions for large infrastructure logging

## Logging Agents

- [LogStash](logstash.md)
- [Fluentd / Fluentbit](fluentd.md)
- [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat)

## CEF - Common Event Format

- Syslog prefix of `<data> <host>`
  - can omit this if writing to file without Syslog, starting instead with just `CEF:version|...|...`
- pre-defined protocol + header fields for product / version with pipe separators
- suffix extension is `key=value` pairs
- UTF-8 encoded entire message
- pipes `|` must be escaped with backslash in header portion but not extension portion
- equal `=` must be escaped with backslash in extension portion but not header portion
- newlines must be encoded as `\r` or `\n` to keep it on one line

eg. from Implementing ArcSight Common Event Format pdf:

```log
Jan 18 11:07:53 host CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Device Event Class ID|Name|Severity|[Extension]
```

eg.

```log
Jan 18 11:07:53 host CEF:0|Security|threatmanager|1.0|100|worm successfully stopped|10|src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2 spt=1232
```
