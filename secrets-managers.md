# Password Managers

These are both a great convenience that allow you to use different passwords everywhere to mitigate the risks when one site or another inevitably gets hacked (see https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

However, they also represent a single point of failure they themselves get hacked.

- [Google Password Manager](https://passwords.google.com/?pli=1) - built-in to the Chrome browser. If Google gets hacked it's game over because everybody relies on Google for GMail and SSO auth logins.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)
- LastPass - don't use this one - they've been hacked before. I'm not even going to provide a link to this.
