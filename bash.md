# Bash - Shell & Scripting

This is the standard modern shell. You should always script in Bash for portability.

It's a rare exception where you'd need to script in the original Bourne shell
(bootstrapping [Alpine](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Dockerfiles/blob/master/alpine-dev/Dockerfile)
is one of the few use cases for that).
