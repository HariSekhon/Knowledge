## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

## Hotels vs Airbnb

Hotels and Airbnb vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

### Parking

If driving, make sure to double check parking at hotels or Airbnbs.

If Expedia shows `Parking Available` include of `Parking Included`, that means there will be parking charges,
which can be quite high.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the hotel listing to found out what the charges are in the small print.

I often prefer booking places a bit away from the centers to get easier parking as many central accomodations,
both hotels and airbnbs lack good parking.

Also, if you're only going into the centres in the evenings, often you can get cheap or even free parking.

## Driving

Ferries are surprisingly expensive, similar in price to an air fair.

This probably works out a little more economical if having more than one person in the car.

You should book ahead of time due to limited slots, and for better pricing.

### Driving Checklist

Police may refuse you entry or blackmail you out of money if you don't have all of the following documents:

- Passport
- UK driver's license
- International driver's permit (get this from the Post Office it's only around £5 but requires a passport photo)
- Insurance certificate
- Vehicle Registration V5C paper proof of ownership
  - [Serbian](#serbia) police refused to accept digital proof of ownership via insurance certificate
  - they insisted on physical original paper copy
  - they said it was the equivalent to *"Passport for the car"*

### Additional EU Driving Checklist

Driving in the EU additionally requires:

- breakdown kit (AA does one), including:
  - high viz jacket (which must be available in the passenger compartment
  - breakdown triangle
  - headlamp converters

Headlamp converters are basically headlamp stickers that change the glare direction of your headlamps to shine the other
way because you drive on the right in Europe instead of the left like in the UK.

Apparently the French police are likely to pull you over and fine you if you don't have these.

## Phones, E-Sims & Mobile Internet Access

Digital e-sims where you can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

- <https://www.airalo.com/> - follow the installation instructions and make sure to enable `Data Roaming`
  under the e-sim settings otherwise the internet won't connect
- <https://esim.holafly.com/>

### EU Roaming

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- France
- Germany
- Poland
- Lithuania
- Latvia
- Estonia
- Sweden
- Slovakia
- Hungary

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

## Countries

Some more specific tips for different countries.

### Belgium

Nice small country, easy to drive from the UK, perhaps 2-3 hours after a ferry from Dover to Calais.

#### Brussels

A bit of a western capital dump with high immigration, graffiti etc.

#### Bruges/Brugges / Ghent/Gent

West Belgium is nicer, particularly Bruges, Ghent etc.

#### Liege

Liege is worse than Brussels, with high incidence of homelessness and street begging.

### France

A surprising number of people in France do not speak English at all.

If you've been travelling to other countries where they often accommodate English speakers this might come as a
surprise for a country close to England.

### Germany

#### Driving

The autobahn - the german highway - is long.

If you have a need for speed, Germany is probably one of the best places to drive your car.

Germany is a much bigger country which you feel after driving through Belgium and then hitting the much more vast
driving distances in Germany.

You can expect to drive for 8 hours to go from West to East Germany.

#### Berlin

Berlin is a relatively affordable capital with good restaurants
and what feels like much lower population density than London.

It is not as popping as London at 9pm on a Saturday night as a result though.

### Poland

One of my favourite countries.

- Low immigration
- Feels safer than the UK, and this seems to be supported by crime stats
- Food is good and reasonably priced
- Airbnbs are expensive though
- Poland is not a cheap country any more
- Large country tht takens 6-8 hours to drive across
- Parking is often cheap or free after 8pm, which is great for going out to get dinner in the centres.

#### Sopot

The most expensive area in Poland, near Gdansk.

Good beaches, restaurants, and walkways.

#### Gdansk

A port town in the north of Poland.

Good restaurants and old town.

Not cheap. My Airbnb cost me more than in Dubai.

One of my colleagues is a contractor in Gdansk so gave me the local tour.

Taxis may rip you off if they hear you speak English.
He said you can get away without paying them if they don't put the meter on.
I don't know if this is true as I was driving so didn't try it.

He compared Uber like taxis apps when we went out.

Gdansk has ferry connections to Sweden.
There was zero border control coming off the ferry from Sweden to Gdansk, which surprised me.

#### Warsaw

Decent low pressure capital.

One of my colleagues moved back to Warsaw as a contractor.

#### Krakow

Tourist hotspot.

*"F\*ck Warsaw, go to Krakow!"*, one of my Polish colleagues told me. He was right.

### Hungary

Do not drive through northern Hungary, there are serious ghettos that feel very unsafe:

### Serbia

I used the <https://www.airalo.com/> e-sim data only for $14 for 5GB valid for 30 days.

#### Driving

Expect a 3 hour queues at the Serbian border.

I asked a guy in the queue of cars in front of me and he said 3-4 hours was common.

**IMPORTANT** - Make sure you have every document possible including your vehicle registration otherwise the Serbian police
will either refuse to let you in or blackmail you out money. Don't ask me how I know this.

See the [Driving Checklist](#driving-checklist) above.

I also saw several people pulled over by Serbian police.

Be wary of Serbian police. *"You are not in the EU now"* as they said to me.

Overall, a horrible experience driving to Serbia and I would not do it again.

You immediately feel like you've gone from Europe to some dangerous 3rd world country where you are more worried about
the police themselves.

### South Africa

A dangerous high crime country due to high inequality (the Gini coefficient of inequality correlates to crime).

You will need a car in South Africa as its road infrastructure and distancing is similar to the US.

Make sure to lock your doors immediately to reduce risk of carjacking.

#### Johannesburg

Johannesburg, the capital, is where the biz is, where people cite Cape Town by the beach for leisure.

Houses have bars on their windows, barred gates with 2 dogs, and guns for good reason.
Violent home invasions are a common problem -
one of my colleauges in the UK emigrated from South Africa after a home invasion
where they pulled the gate off and invaded a mere 30 minutes after his family had left.
You may only get one close call like that in life.

Stick to the foreigner areas of Sandton and Rosebank. Seriously.

##### Sandton

Has a good mall, restaurants and hotels. The Da Vinci hotel is nice for example.

Nelson Mandela square should be relatively safe thanks to being surrounded by restaurants and mall with security.

##### Rosebank

Also has a mall and good restaurants.

Restaurants on the street outside the mall are patrolled by street security to ensure you make it back to your car.

### Sweden

Ferry from Tallinn in Estonia to Sweden and then another ferry down to Gdanks, Poland, is a way out if your license gets suspended for speeding in Latvia.

Police pulled me over coming off the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia,
and did a very invasive search of my car and all luggage, they opened everything, down to my toiletries and car bonnet.

### UAE - Dubai

I used Virgin Mobile on a prepaid contract for around £200 for the year which was the cheapest deal I could find.

#### Banking

- [Mashreq](https://www.mashreq.com/) is the easiest to use, app-only like Starling or Monzo
- [ADCB]() is the next best, but the premium account is a big hassle and has a minimum balance requirement
- [Emirates NBD](https://www.emiratesnbd.com/en) has a bad reputation among my peers for being a lot of hassle
  - they were a hassle to open, wanting salary certificate
  - even closing the account is difficult apparently
- [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.ae/) was a similar hassle to NBD above wanting salary certificate addressed specifically to them
  - much more than HSBC back in the UK
  - even having an HSBC account in the UK doesn't help
