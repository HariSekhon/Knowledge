## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

## Hotels vs Airbnb

Hotels and Airbnb vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

## Phones, E-Sims & Mobile Internet Access

Digital e-sims where you can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

### EU Roaming

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- France
- Germany
- Poland
- Lithuania
- Latvia
- Estonia
- Sweden
- Slovakia
- Hungary

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

## Countries

Some more specific tips for different countries.

### Hungary

Do not drive through northern Hungary, there are serious ghettos that feel very unsafe:

### Serbia

I used the <https://www.airalo.com/> e-sim data only for $14 for 5GB valid for 30 days.

Serbian police didn't want to let me in without a V5C vehicle registration certificate,
despite showing passport, UK driver's license, international driver's license, and ar insurance certificate.

I also saw several people pulled over by Serbian police.

Be warned.

### Sweden

Ferry from Tallinn in Estonia to Sweden and then another ferry down to Gdanks, Poland, is a way out if your license gets suspended for speeding in Latvia.

Police pulled me over coming off the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia,
and did a very invasive search of my car and all luggage, they opened everything, down to my toiletries and car bonnet.

### UAE - Dubai

I used Virgin Mobile on a prepaid contract for around Â£200 for the year which was the cheapest deal I could find.

#### Banking

- [Mashreq](https://www.mashreq.com/) is the easiest to use, app-only like Starling or Monzo
- [ADCB]() is the next best, but the premium account is a big hassle and has a minimum balance requirement
- [Emirates NBD](https://www.emiratesnbd.com/en) has a bad reputation among my peers for being a lot of hassle
  - they were a hassle to open, wanting salary certificate
  - even closing the account is difficult apparently
- [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.ae/) was a similar hassle to NBD above wanting salary certificate addressed specifically to them
  - much more than HSBC back in the UK
  - even having an HSBC account in the UK doesn't help
